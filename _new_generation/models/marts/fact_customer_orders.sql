/***
    1. ENVIRONMENT SETUP
        - Enable dataset on seeds
        - Enable legacy models
        - Enable Macros (e.g. audit_helper)
        - Push to Remote Repo
        - Lower Case

    2. SOURCE ENABLEMENT
        - Create Sources
        - Update Sources
        - Tidy Up

    3. LOGIC CTE ENABLEMENT
        - Intermediary-ing UP
        - Simplifying column name modification on CTE logic and move to the source table
            - payments
            - orders
            - customers
